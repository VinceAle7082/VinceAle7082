# Hey all, Vincenzo Aleksey Brocato here!

  * *My mail is vinceale7082@vinceale7082is-a.dev is my commit email, but you can reach me out at vinceale7082@gmail.com*

# Who am I?
Hi, I'm just an italian student that likes Ace Attorney and codes, because he likes to do it.
I'm using a Raspberry Pi 5 4GB to host my projects. I have a domain at is-a.dev and I don't know what to write.

## My projects
Here are my projects:
  * [XanvicOS](https://vinceale7082.is-a.dev:3000/VinceAle7082/XanvicOS)   (In Developement...);
  * [Website](https://vinceale7082.is-a.dev)  (Finished, someday I'll add CSS);
  * SunshineWM (Not Started);
